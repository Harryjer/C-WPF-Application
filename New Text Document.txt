WPF application from visual studio IDE
1/ create the database and add two relevant tables.
2/ add the foreign key.
	Hotel_Id should be in as Hotel(int) in the Room Table.
alter Table Room add foreign key(Hotel) references Hotel(Hotel_Id)
this is the query that we need to type for the foreign key.

3/ after executing the query we can check it from the table foreign keys.

4/Let's create the project.(WPF application)

5/ In here we can see the front end (XAML) and the backend part(.cs)

6/ now we need to connect to our database using visual studio.

7/ After that we need to add a new item.(LINQ to SQL classes.)
(if you do not have the LINQ to SQL classes item in the add new section, you can add it from there.

8/ In the data class file, we need to add two tables that we were created before.

9/ Lets add some related data to the tables that we created.(We have to use the hotel ID as the coloumn data in the room table.)

10/ Now we have to design our first interface.
	1. First we need to add 2 row definitions and 2 colomun definition
	2. we need to set the height and the width.
	3. Then add a text(Lable) and a text box for a search function.
	4. Then we need to add the list box to show out some details.
	5. We need to add 2 more row definitions and coloumn definitions inside the grid.
	6. Then add the image source method for the loading images to the list box.
	7. Then add a text block(Lable) to show the hotel name in the interface with their related image.

11/ After finishing the interface, we need to list out the back end process.

12/ Let's see how a search function will work on this interface.
	1. we have to select textchanged function from the propeties.

13/ Now we create our second interface(2nd WPF application)

14/ Let's design our interface.

15/ Then we need to import the related data to the interface.
16/ we need to create the selectionchanged function in the previous interface.

17/ In the previous one we had some issue in the main class.(I had corrected it now)

18/ Let's create our last interface and it's for the room details.

19/ Let's focus on the back-end part of both the hotel detail interface and room detail interface.

20/ Let's code for the insert update delete functions.


alter Table Room add foreign key(Hotel) references Hotel(Hotel_Id)
